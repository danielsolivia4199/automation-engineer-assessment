# Automation Engineer Assessment
## Description
### Scenario:
You are given an API that manages user data for a small application. The API has endpoints for creating a user, retrieving all users, retrieving a user by ID, updating a user, and deleting a user.

### Task:
Write integration tests for the following API endpoints using JavaScript and any testing framework of your choice (e.g., Jest, Mocha):

- POST /users - Create a new user
  - Test that a valid user is created successfully and returns a 201 status code.
  - Test input validation: sending invalid data should return a 400 status code.
  - Test handling of duplicate users (email needs to be unique).

- GET /users
    - Test that it returns all users with a 200 status code.
    - Test that it returns an empty array if no users are found.

- GET /users/{id} - Retrieve a user by ID
  - Test that it returns the correct user details with a 200 status code.
  - Test that it returns a 404 status code if the user is not found.

- PATCH /users/{id} - Update a user
  - Test updating user details successfully returns a 204 status code.
  - Test that the user details are updated correctly.
  - Test that it handles non-existing users by returning a 404 status code.
  - Test input validation (e.g., invalid email format should return a 400 status code).

- DELETE /users/{id} - Delete a user
  - Test successful deletion returns a 204 status code.
  - Test deletion of a non-existing user returns a 404 status code.

### Instructions:
- Write clear and concise tests, ensuring they are independent of each other.
- Use async/await for handling asynchronous operations.
- Include comments explaining the purpose of each test case.
- Provide setup and teardown methods for your test cases if needed.

### Submission Requirements:
- Fork this repository and commit your code to your fork.
- Add @mikeulvila as a collaborator to your forked repository.
- Ensure all tests pass successfully.
- Document any assumptions made during the testing process.
